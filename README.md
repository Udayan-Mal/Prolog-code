# Prolog-Programs


This repository contains the solution for the AI Lab exam, which involves working with Prolog and HTML files. The project includes a set of Prolog code files, as well as an HTML file for web-based presentation.

## Project Structure
- **Prolog Code**: Contains Prolog code to solve various logic programming tasks.
- **index.html**: An HTML file for displaying results and information on a web page.

## How to Run the Project

### Running Prolog Code:
1. Install [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html).
2. Load the Prolog files into the SWI-Prolog environment.
3. Execute the queries to get the results.

### Viewing the Web Page:
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2. The web page will display the output generated from the Prolog code.
